# Grokking Algorithms - C/C++ Practice

C/C++ implementations and practice exercises from "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava.

## 📁 Structure

```
├── reference_code/          # Original C/C++ implementations from the book
└── exercises/               # My practice solutions (work in progress)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Compile and run examples
g++ -std=c++11 reference_code/01_introduction_to_algorithms/c++11/01_binary_search.cpp -o binary_search

# Work on exercises
cd exercises/03_recursion/4.4_recursive_binary_search/
make
```

## 🧹 Maintenance

This repository uses a cleanup script to maintain focus on C/C++ implementations:

```bash
# Run cleanup script (removes non-C/C++ language folders)
./cleanup_languages.sh
```

**Note:** The cleanup script removed 211+ directories of other programming languages to keep the repository focused and lightweight.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning repository, but feel free to:

- **Report bugs** in implementations
- **Suggest improvements** to existing code
- **Share your own solutions** to exercises
